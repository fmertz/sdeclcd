-- INTRODUCTION --------------------------------------------------------------

LCDproc is a client/server suite including drivers for all kinds of nifty LCD
devices. The server works with different display sizes and supports several
serial devices: Matrix Orbital, Crystal Fontz, Bayrad, LB216, LCDM001
(kernelconcepts.de), Wirz-SLI and PIC-an-LCD; some devices connected to
the parallel port: HD44780, STV5730, T6963, SED1520 and SED1330; and also
some displays connected via USB: CFontzPacket, CwLnx, IOWarrior, LIS2 and
BWCT.
Various clients are available that display things like CPU load, system load,
memory usage, uptime, and a lot more.

LCDproc also supports key or remote control input for controlling the clients.

The client and the server use a TCP connection to communicate, so it is
possible to have a client on a box in Sweden showing its stats on a LCD
display in the United States.

Our web site is located at http://lcdproc.org/
For new versions and CVS go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/lcdproc/

Check there first for new versions or updates. For remaining questions,
you can ask the mailing list. For how to get on the mailing list, see
the main web site.

LCDproc was originally written by William W. Ferrell <wwf@splatwerks.org>
and Selene Scriven <lcdproc@toykeeper.net>.

-- INSTALLATION --------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to the INSTALL file included with this archive for installation
instructions (including how to connect the LCD to your system).

-- CHANGES -------------------------------------------------------------------

Woow...  a lot.  :)
See the ChangeLog file for more details.

-- HELPING OUT ---------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing you should do is join the mailing list, to do so, go to out
web site and click on MAIL and follow the instructions.

If you get the urge to help out by writing code, take a look at the TODO
file to see what we think that needs to be done. If you want to work on
something, or you want to add something different, tell it on the
mailing list. Maybe someone is already working on the part, and maybe someone
has already writen something that you can use. New ideas are always welcome !

To learn more about how LCDproc works, first have a look at the docs/
directory. Some important things are documented there, but because this is
still somewhat a big hacking project, some documentation will be missing ;)

-- SPECIAL THANKS ------------------------------------------------------------

LCDproc is a community effort, and as such we'd like to recognize everyone's
efforts. We've tried to list all the people that have contributed in the
CREDITS file. Thanks all !
